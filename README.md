# Farm-to-you

Farmers have always been a victim of the system ever since globalization started in India. Farmers are constantly underpaid even if their product is of high quality, yet they have to sell based on the brokers' price. Meanwhile, customers in city have lost trust on the quality of vegetables and fruits, people tend to have the dilemma on few of the fruits and vegetables being grown with pesticide or other harmful chemicals. 
So, to put an end to all this, we have come up with a new system where we can track the product from the time it is harvested till it is brought to your hands. We can directly look into the details on how the product was grown, what materials were used, and compare different farms and buy directly which suits us.  Conversely, the farmers can get better profits based on the quality of the product produced. 
As this system connects the farmer and the vendors or end consumers directly, the middlemen is cut in the process, leading to reduced prices for the customer and higher profit margins for the farmers as buying cost and farmer selling cost would always be similar. 
Hence we can eat better by knowing better, while the farmers can sell better from the comfort of their villages and earn well, which is a win-win situation for everyone. This can help bridge the gap between cities and villages.
